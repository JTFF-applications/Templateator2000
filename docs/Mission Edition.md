This guide will help you to create misison in DCS World that will be next scripted using Templateator 2000.

## - Tankers / Awacs

To add Tankers or Awacs, you need to create a group with the unit you want as a model in late activation (everywhere you want).<br>
Make sure you set the group name and the unit name to be able to find it easily.

Then, place an orbit unit (a boat or a ground unit) where you want the tanker/awacs racetrack. The easiest are submarines and Infantry M4.<br>
Set the unit heading to the direction you want the tanker/awacs to orbit.

You can now add the tanker/awacs using the Templateator 2000 UI.

## - Beacons

You just need a unit that will be the beacon. Place it anywhere you want.

You can now add the beacon using the Templateator 2000 UI.

## - Atis

## - Carrier

Place your standard carrier group as you would be doing it normally.<br>
Make sure you set the group name and the unit name to be able to find it easily.
